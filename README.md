# Syllabit

Scan up to an entire page worth of words using your iDevice's camera, and have words automatically syllabified!

Example: computer -> com-put-er

This app aims to help automate the syllabification of words for those who do it often (EG; reading specalists)

Note: Not all words work perfectly, syllables are, quite frankly, hard. This implementation should be good enough, and if words aren't exactly right, I'll get around to fixing them.


Updates before releasing:

- Add major UI tweaks and animations
- Add haptic feedback
- Add flash function on camera
- Do final check of words and syllabification of them
- Allow punctuation to not break program
